# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Cashfree Payment Gateway integration into the Flutter TV subscription app. The integration must ensure secure, in-app payment processing using the official Cashfree SDK, with proper backend validation and webhook handling. The payment flow will support multiple payment methods (Cards, UPI, Wallets, NetBanking) while maintaining security best practices by keeping sensitive keys on the backend only.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to make payments for TV subscriptions directly within the app, so that I have a seamless and secure payment experience without being redirected to external browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a payment THEN the system SHALL open the payment interface within the app using Cashfree SDK
2. WHEN the payment screen loads THEN the system SHALL display all available payment methods (Cards, UPI, Wallets, NetBanking)
3. WHEN a user completes payment THEN the system SHALL process the payment without redirecting to external browsers
4. IF the payment is successful THEN the system SHALL return success status to the app
5. IF the payment fails THEN the system SHALL return failure status with appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure payment security by keeping sensitive credentials on the backend, so that the app remains secure and compliant with payment standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app needs to initiate payment THEN the system SHALL request payment_session_id from backend only
2. WHEN creating payment orders THEN the backend SHALL use App ID and Secret Key to communicate with Cashfree API
3. WHEN the app processes payments THEN the system SHALL never expose Secret Key or App ID in the mobile app
4. WHEN using Cashfree APIs THEN the backend SHALL handle all server-to-server communications
5. IF sandbox environment is active THEN the system SHALL use sandbox keys only

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want payment verification through webhooks and API calls, so that payment status is accurately tracked even if the app crashes or network fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a payment is completed THEN Cashfree SHALL send webhook notification to backend
2. WHEN payment result is received in app THEN the system SHALL verify order status with backend using Cashfree Verify API
3. WHEN webhook is received THEN the backend SHALL update payment status in database
4. IF app crashes during payment THEN the webhook SHALL ensure payment status is still captured
5. IF network drops during payment THEN the verification API SHALL provide accurate final status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper SDK configuration and permissions, so that the payment gateway functions correctly across different Android versions and network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is built THEN the system SHALL include Internet permission in Android manifest
2. WHEN the app runs THEN the system SHALL support Android API level 21 and above
3. WHEN UPI payments are made THEN the system SHALL handle UPI intents properly
4. WHEN the Cashfree SDK is initialized THEN the system SHALL use the correct environment (sandbox/production)
5. IF payment requires external UPI apps THEN the system SHALL handle app switching gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want comprehensive testing capabilities, so that all payment scenarios are validated before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing payments THEN the system SHALL support Cashfree sandbox test cards and UPI IDs
2. WHEN testing success scenarios THEN the system SHALL properly handle successful payment flows
3. WHEN testing failure scenarios THEN the system SHALL properly handle payment failures and cancellations
4. WHEN testing network issues THEN the system SHALL handle poor network conditions gracefully
5. WHEN testing app crashes THEN the system SHALL recover payment status through webhooks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper production deployment configuration, so that the payment gateway works securely in the live environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL use production keys instead of sandbox keys
2. WHEN backend is deployed THEN the system SHALL run on HTTPS protocol only
3. WHEN configuring Cashfree dashboard THEN the system SHALL whitelist correct app package and domain
4. WHEN setting up webhooks THEN the system SHALL configure correct callback and webhook URLs
5. IF production deployment is complete THEN the system SHALL validate all payment flows in live environment
